System hardening is the process of reducing sercurity risk by stripping a system down to its most important functions and services as well as implementing sound security configurations.<br/>

Some major security configurations that one must be aware of are:
- Disabling unnecessary services and applications
- Change system defaults (e.g. credentials, service ports)
- Configure and install logging and anti-virus/malware (OS dependent)
- Ensure correct permissions in vital locations


1. Disabling unnecessary services and applications
<br/>
Depending on your security architecture, it may be more prudent to strip applications from a system that has already been set up. Otherwise, it is always good practice to start with a minimum installation of the given OS and installing only applications and services directly related to the system's planned use. It is important to note that service and application configuration must be done with security in mind.

2. Change system defaults
<br/>
It is crucial that system defaults are changed, meaning default credentials for applications and services as well as service ports used.
