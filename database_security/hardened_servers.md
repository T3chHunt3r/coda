# Platform Hardening & Software Patch Management

**System hardening** is the process of ensuring that a system only runs the services and functions that it is supposed to. That is, removing any unnecessary applications and services that do not fall within the system's planned use. By having fewer programs and less functionality, a system has less risk of affecting operational issues, misconfigurations, incompatibilities and possible compromise. This **improved security** reduces the viable attack surfaces, which can lower the statistical likelihood of data breaches, unauthorized access, system hacking or malware. Additionally, system hardening paves the way for a simplified process for compliance and auditability, meaning a cleaner environment leads to quick and easy indentification of all the moving parts helping with transparency.

Software patch management is the process of ensuring that all services and applications running within a given system has been updated with the latest security patches in order to make sure that there are as few security holes as possible. Many data breaches are due to a company's lack of adherence to this rule.

Some major security configurations that one must be aware of are:
- Disabling unnecessary services and applications
- Change system defaults (e.g. credentials, service ports, permissions)
- Configure and install security applications and anti-virus/malware


1. Disabling unnecessary services and applications
<br/>
Depending on your security architecture, it may be more prudent to strip applications from a system that has already been set up. Otherwise, it is always good practice to start with a minimum installation of the given OS and installing only applications and services directly related to the system's planned use. It is important to note that service and application configuration must be done with security in mind.

2. Change system defaults
<br/>
It is crucial that system defaults are changed, meaning default credentials for applications and services as well as service ports used. Additionally, ensuring that proper permissions are set for vital components of the system directory.

3. Configure and install security applications and anti-virus/malware
<br/>
Depending on the platform installed, it may be crucial to install an anti-virus/malware program ensuring detection and protection from known threats plagueging the web. Additionally, extra security steps should be taken when attempting to access a given system, such as installing multi-factor authentication.

In this step, we will go through with creating a new user and setting up multi-factor authentication access to the platform.
