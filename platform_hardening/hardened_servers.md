System hardening is the process of reducing sercurity risk by stripping a system down to its most important functions and services as well as implementing sound security configurations.<br/>
Some major security configurations that one must be aware of are:
- Disabling unnecessary services and applications
- Change system defaults (e.g. credentials, service ports)
- Configure and install logging and anti-virus/malware (OS dependent)
- Ensure correct permissions in vital locations

In this first part we will go through the system's installed applications and proceed with removing any unnecessary ones.
