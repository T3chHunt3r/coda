System hardening is the process of ensuring that a system only runs the services and functions that it is supposed to. That is, removing any unnecessary applications and services that do not fall within the system's planned use. By having fewer programs and less functionality, a system has less risk of affecting operational issues, misconfigurations, incompatibilities and possible comprimise. This **improved security** reduced the viable attack surfaces, which can lower the statistical likelihood of data breaches, unauthorized access, system hacking or malware. Additionally, system hardening paves the way for a simplified process for compliance and auditability, meaning a cleaner environment leads to quick and easy indentification of all the moving parts helping with transparency.
