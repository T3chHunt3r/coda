**System hardening** is the process of ensuring that a system only runs the services and functions that it is supposed to. That is, removing any unnecessary applications and services that do not fall within the system's planned use. By having fewer programs and less functionality, a system has less risk of affecting operational issues, misconfigurations, incompatibilities and possible compromise. This **improved security** reduces the viable attack surfaces, which can lower the statistical likelihood of data breaches, unauthorized access, system hacking or malware. Additionally, system hardening paves the way for a simplified process for compliance and auditability, meaning a cleaner environment leads to quick and easy indentification of all the moving parts helping with transparency.

Software patch management is the process of ensuring that all services and applications running within a given system has been updated with the latest security patches in order to make sure that there are as few security holes as possible. Many data breaches are due to a company's lack of adherence to this rule.
